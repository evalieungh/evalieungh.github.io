Welcome! 

I'm Eva, currently a researcher at the Natural History Museum in Oslo, Norway. 

Ecologists seek to explain diversity in nature and how living things relate to the physical environment. How do species interact with each other and the environment to assemble into communities and ecosystems across time and space? As a plant ecologist, my scientific interests lie in discovering how the functional diversity of plants relates to a changing environment. During my PhD, I analysed alpine plant dynamics under climate warming, with both statistical and process-based models. I also study consistency and quality in field-based vegetation mapping and ecological diversity in Norway. Going forward, I believe ecologists have much to gain from improving process-based models. Simulating ecological processes starting from first principles is a valuable way to test hypotheses of natural diversity and interplay between species and their physical environment. To sate our curiosity, and find solutions needed to make a better future, I put greatest faith in deeply collaborative, open, and interdisciplinary science projects.
